          I have been working in the Film and TV industry since graduating from 
          University in 2013. I began freelancing going from one shoot to the 
          next working as a Runner with Call Box Diary Service. I've gained my 
          experience by working on a wide range of commercials, online content, 
          music promos and short films but also have experience in TV, 
          documentary film and in house at various production companies.

          I'm now emerging in to the world of production working as an assistant. 
          By keeping as busy as I can and learning as much as possible I hope to 
          one day become an Executive Producer.
