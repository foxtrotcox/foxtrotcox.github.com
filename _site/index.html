          I have been working in the Film and TV industry since graduating from 
          University in 2013. I began freelancing going from one shoot to the 
          next working as a Runner with Call Box Diary Service. I've gained my 
          experience by working on a wide range of commercials, online content, 
          music promos and short films but also have experience in TV, 
          documentary film and in house at various production companies. 
        </p>

          I'm now emerging in to the world of production working as an assistant. 
          By keeping as busy as I can and learning as much as possible I hope to 
          one day become an Executive Producer.
